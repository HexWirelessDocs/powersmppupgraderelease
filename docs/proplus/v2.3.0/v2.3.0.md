# 🔍 Feature Highlights  
## With Real-World Use Cases

## 1. **ESME-Specific Routing & Rate Plans**

### 🎯 Fine-Grained SMPP-Level Control  
You can now configure routing rules and pricing **exclusively for ESME accounts**, offering unmatched precision for SMPP-based clients.

### **What’s New**
- ESME-specific routing rules  
- ESME-specific rate plans  
- Routing Simulator updated to support ESME-based decisions  
- Unified behaviour across **Web, API, and SMPP**  

### **Why It Matters**
Many users operate multiple SMPP accounts under one parent profile—each handling different geographies, use cases, or traffic types.  
This enhancement ensures every ESME gets **its own routing logic and pricing model**.

### **Real-World Use Cases**
- **Multi-SMPP Resellers:** Set unique routes and rates for 20+ ESMEs without creating multiple users  
- **Dedicated OTP Routing:** Assign high-priority/premium routes for OTP traffic while keeping marketing traffic cost-efficient  
- **Regional Rate Plans for Aggregators:** Assign different pricing per ESME based on regions

## 2. **Gateway-to-Gateway Hopping Mechanism**

### ⚡ Next-Level Delivery Resilience  
Introducing a smart failover mechanism that automatically switches between up to **four alternate gateways** when the primary is unreachable.

### **What’s New**
- Configure **up to 4 backup gateways**  
- Intelligent retry behaviour based on gateway state  
- Improved global failover handling  
- Enhanced error-based recovery logic  

### **Why It Matters**
Gateway outages, congestion, or regional carrier issues can cause delivery failures.  
This mechanism ensures the system **automatically finds the best possible route**—without manual intervention.

### **Real-World Use Cases**
- **Guaranteed OTP Delivery:** Ensures OTPs are never stuck during peaks  
- **International Aggregators:** Seamless fallback across multiple global gateways  
- **Load Balancing:** Smart traffic distribution across preferred carriers

## 3. **Content-Based Routing**

### 🧠 Intelligent Routing Based on Message Text  
The system now evaluates message content and makes routing decisions using advanced matching conditions.

### **Supported Conditions**
- Contains  
- Starts With  
- Ends With  
- Equals / Not Equals  
- Any  

### **Why It Matters**
Ideal for clients handling multiple message types—OTP, transactional, promotional—under a single account.

### **Real-World Use Cases**
- **OTP vs Promotional Segregation:** OTP → premium routes; Promo → cost-effective routes  
- **WhatsApp → SMS Failover:** Template keywords trigger fallback flows  
- **Industry-Specific Logic:**  
  - Fintech: Route “transaction” messages to high-priority paths  
  - Travel: “Booking/PNR” confirmations → premium routes  
  - Marketing: “Offer/Discount” → promotional gateways

## 4. **User-Specific Low Credit Threshold**

### 📉 Personalized Billing Alerts  
Users can now configure their own credit threshold to ensure alerts match their consumption behaviour.

### **What’s New**
- Per-user threshold settings  
- Automatic fallback to global threshold if unset  
- Email alerts triggered automatically  

### **Why It Matters**
Different users have different traffic patterns.  
A fixed global threshold doesn't suit everyone—this feature ensures alerts fire exactly when expected.

### **Real-World Use Cases**
- **High-Volume Campaign Users:** Prevents campaign disruption due to low balance  
- **Resellers with Downstream Clients:** Configure thresholds based on client category  
- **Corporate Clients:** Align alerting to monthly budget limits
